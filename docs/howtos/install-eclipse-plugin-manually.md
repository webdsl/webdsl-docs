!!! warning ""

    It is recommended that the `eclipse.ini` of Eclipse is updated to give WebDSL enough stack space and memory to function correctly. Include the following options in `eclipse.ini`, below the line that starts with `-vmargs`.

    ```
    -Xss8m -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -server
    ```

    On {{ os.macos }} this file can be found at `Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini`.
