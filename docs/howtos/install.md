# Install WebDSL
To get started with WebDSL, install the WebDSL editor and the WebDSL Command-Line interface.

## WebDSL Editor
We provide an [Eclipse][1] bundle in which you can create and edit WebDSL applications with the assistance of syntax highlighting, static analysis and code completion. Alternatively, you can download the WebDSL plugin in your own Eclipse instance.

=== "Recommended: Eclipse Bundle"
    Download an Eclipse instance with the latest WebDSL plugin pre-installed for your platform:

    [:fontawesome-solid-download: WebDSL in Eclipse bundle](https://buildfarm.metaborg.org/view/WebDSL/job/webdsl-eclipsegen/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/eclipse/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

    [Installation instructions](../install-eclipse-bundle/).

=== "Alternative: Eclipse Plugin"
    Perform a manual installation of the WebDSL plugin in [Eclipse 3.5][1] or newer through the update site:

    ```
    https://update.webdsl.org/update
    ```

    [Installation instructions](../install-eclipse-plugin-manually/).

## Command-Line Interface
The WebDSL CLI transforms your WebDSL code to web applications.

=== "Recommended: Download Latest Build"
    Download the WebDSL CLI for your platform:

    [:fontawesome-solid-download: WebDSL CLI](https://buildfarm.metaborg.org/job/webdsl-compiler/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/webdsl.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

    [Installation instructions](../install-cli/).
